# Paoer-Pac

Pac-Man rendition programmed with Lua in the Love2D engine.

In order to run, download the Love2D game engine along with the zip of the repository. Extract the files and create a desktop shortcut for Love2D. Drag/drop the extracted folder onto the desktop icon and the game will begin.

The three "level.txt" files serve as level editors and can be used to create custom levels.

The object of the game is to eat every piece of food in order to progress to the next level. If you are caught by the ghosts, then you will respawn back at the start point of the level but the game state will be kept in tact. Running out of lives results in the game restarting back at level 1.
